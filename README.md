# ATM-Project
We are going to make a simple ATM Machine system that will show account details with userâ€™s accounts and passwords. And the user will be able to perform quick self-service transactions such as cash withdrawal, deposits, and check balance.
 To access the account here are the account number and passwords:
                    #Account Number:2012020116,Pass:116);
                    #Account Number:2012020107,Pass:107);
                    #Account Number:2012020133,Pass:133);
                    #Account Number:2012020131,Pass:131);
#Complected
#The Programm worked
